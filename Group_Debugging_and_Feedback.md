# How-to for Group Debugging and Feedback Session (15 min total)

1. Read the [instructions](https://github.com/seraphinatarrant/neural-generation/blob/master/Web_Demo_Guide.md) (a few minutes). 
2. Spend (roughly) half the time playing with `Auto` mode, and half playing with `Interactive` mode. (5 min each, 10 total)
3. Have fun! Try different inputs and ways of interacting. Important things: don't purposefully
try to break the system. But also don't try to be easy on it. Just play with it and try to generate 
fun or interesting stories. Feel free to use the Advanced Options.
4. You will run into a few types of errors. Either make a quick note or take a screenshot (depending which is more informative).
Some example Error Types (you do not have to classify them, unless you want to):
* _Confusing UI_. e.g. "I don't understand what this message means" or "when I click here I expect X, but Y happens instead."
* _UI bug_. e.g. "This button doesn't work"
* _Weird Logic in system_. e.g. "Whenever I use a word with a hyphen, this weird thing happens"
* _Feature Requests_. e.g. "I found that I always really wished I could do X, because it would make Y better/easier/etc"
5. Compile your feedback (a few minutes). Write your notes in a way that other people can read it, and
include relevant screenshots or details. Feel free to also give qualitative thoughts like, "I thought X was super fun/cool"


_Note to the person collecting feedback:_
Make sure to label and save the logging files from this period of time, so that you can reference it in case it is helpful for understanding any of the feedback.
They are written to the `Plan-and-Write/server/` dir of the person hosting the demo.
