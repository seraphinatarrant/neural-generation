# Neural Generative Models

Hi! At the moment, this is just an area for documentation on the systems I've made. 

* For an overview on how to use the Story Writing UI, go here: [Web_Demo_Guide](https://github.com/seraphinatarrant/neural-generation/blob/master/Web_Demo_Guide.md) (you will find the link to the UI here)
* For a short intro to how to do an Interaction based experiment, go here: [Interact_and_Learn](https://github.com/seraphinatarrant/neural-generation/blob/master/Interact_and_Learn.md)
* For instructions on doing a UI debugging session, go here: [Group_Debugging](https://github.com/seraphinatarrant/neural-generation/blob/master/Group_Debugging_and_Feedback.md)

Feel free to shoot me any questions! [serif@uw.edu](mailto:serif@uw.edu)

# FAQ:
Q: How long does generating stories take?
A: Usually about 10 seconds. But if a lot of people are using it...it can take like a minute. It's all on a few CPUs unfortunately. 

Q: Is it down?
A: Sometimes for experiments, I host this on my personal computer, so sometimes it does down for like 15 minutes. It should be back up soon. But also you can ping me and I can reboot.
