# Neural Generative Models

Hi! At the moment, this is just an area for documentation on the systems I've made. <br>

The link to the UI is in the Web_Demo_Guide](https://github.com/seraphinatarrant/neural-generation/blob/master/Web_Demo_Guide.md). Just to make you open the documentation even if you don't read it. <br>

* For an overview on how to use the Story Writing UI, go here: [Web_Demo_Guide](https://github.com/seraphinatarrant/neural-generation/blob/master/Web_Demo_Guide.md)
* For a short intro to how to do an Interaction based experiment, go here: [Interact_and_Learn](https://github.com/seraphinatarrant/neural-generation/blob/master/Interact_and_Learn.md)
* For instructions on doing a UI debugging session, go here: [Group_Debugging](https://github.com/seraphinatarrant/neural-generation/blob/master/Group_Debugging_and_Feedback.md)

# FAQ:
**Q:** How long does generating stories take? <br>
**A:** Usually about 10 seconds. But if a lot of people are using it...it can take like a minute. It's all on a few CPUs unfortunately. 

**Q:** Is it down? <br>
**A:** Sometimes for experiments, I host this on my personal computer, so sometimes it does down for like 15 minutes. It should be back up soon. But also you can ping me and I can reboot.

**Q:** What is this nonesense about a stroke in 2011? <br>
**A:** Oh yeah. So, if all the words you put it in are unknown to the model (like, it has never seen them before, also known as Out-of-vocabulary words), then it just says whatever it things is most likely to follow after a super uncommon word. One of the models really likes to tell this one in those cases.
