# Neural Generative Models

Hi! At the moment, this is just an area for documentation on the systems I've made. 

* For an overview on how to use the Story Writing UI, go here: [Web_Demo_Guide](https://github.com/seraphinatarrant/neural-generation/blob/master/Web_Demo_Guide.md)
* For a short intro to how to do an Interaction based experiment, go here: [Interact_and_Learn](https://github.com/seraphinatarrant/neural-generation/blob/master/Interact_and_Learn.md)
* For instructions on doing a UI debugging session, go here: [Group_Debugging](https://github.com/seraphinatarrant/neural-generation/blob/master/Group_Debugging_and_Feedback.md)
